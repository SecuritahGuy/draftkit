✅ Backend Roadmap — draftkid (nfl_data_py–first)

Goal: produce a rock-solid players.json/meta.json tailored to your Yahoo 12-team PPR snake league. Keep it local, reproducible, fast.

0) Repository hygiene (1x)
	•	Add pyproject.toml (editable install) so python -m draftkit works without PYTHONPATH.

[project.scripts]
draftkit = "draftkit.cli:app"


	•	Install locally:

pip install -U pip && pip install -e .



DoD: python -m draftkit --help and draftkit --help both show the CLI.

⸻

1) Historical lookback + blended per-game projections (core)

Why: Stabilizes rankings; fixes odd VORP at QB.
CLI flags: --lookback 3 --blend 0.6,0.3,0.1 --per-game --min-games 8
	•	CLI: add options to src/draftkit/cli.py

@app.command()
def build(year: int = ..., config: Path = ..., outdir: Path = Path("public"),
          lookback: int = 1, blend: str = "", per_game: bool = True, min_games: int = 8, ...):
    # parse blend -> List[float]; derive years = [year-1 ...]


	•	Scoring: implement blending helpers in transforms/scoring.py

def to_season_points(weekly_df, cfg): ...  # current sum/row scoring
def to_season_ppg(weekly_df, cfg, min_games=8): ...
def blend_ppg(ppg_by_year: dict[int, pd.DataFrame], weights: list[float], season_len=17) -> pd.DataFrame:
    # align indices by player_id, weighted sum of PPG, then * season_len


	•	Aggregate logic in CLI:
	1.	Load each lookback season’s weekly; score per-game; filter < min_games.
	2.	Weighted blend → projected season points for target year.
	3.	Pass this single DataFrame to VORP/tiers.

DoD:
	•	Console shows per-position replacement lines that make sense.
	•	Top ~12 QBs have positive VORP (or near zero for QB12).
	•	README updated with example command.

⸻

2) Bye weeks

Why: Avoid bye clustering in snake.
	•	Connector: connectors/nflverse.py

def load_team_schedule(years: list[int]) -> pd.DataFrame: ...
def compute_bye_by_team(schedule_df: pd.DataFrame, year: int) -> dict[str,int]:
    # find week where team has 0 games; { "KC":10, ... }


	•	Merge into players in CLI after blending:

bye_by_tm = compute_bye_by_team(sched, target_year)
df['bye'] = df['team'].map(bye_by_tm)



DoD: Random spot-checks (KC, GB) show correct bye integer in players.json.

⸻

3) Overrides for rookies/role changes

Why: Blend undervalues rookies (MHJ, Caleb).
Format: overrides.csv → columns: player_id,name,pos,tm,points,note(optional)
	•	CLI flag: --overrides overrides.csv
	•	Merge after blending:

if overrides_path and overrides_path.exists():
    ov = pd.read_csv(overrides_path)
    df = df.drop(columns=['points']).merge(ov[['player_id','points']], on='player_id', how='left', suffixes=("","_ovr"))
    df['points'] = df['points_ovr'].fillna(df['points'])
    df['source'] = np.where(df['points_ovr'].notna(), 'override', 'blend')



DoD: Overridden players have source="override" and expected points.

⸻

4) DST scoring (league exact)

Why: You start a DEF; Yahoo bands matter.
	•	New module transforms/scoring_dst.py

def score_dst(weekly_team_df, league_cfg) -> pd.DataFrame:
    # aggregate team defense by season: sacks, ints, fr, tds, points_allowed
    # apply your scoring incl. PA bands to season totals
    # emit: player_id="DEF-<TEAM>", name="<TEAM> D/ST>", pos="DEF"


	•	Integrate into CLI path and include into VORP/tiers (separate positional baseline).

DoD: players.json includes DEF with plausible top-12.

⸻

5) K scoring (baseline, upgradeable)

Why: You start a K.
	•	New transforms/scoring_k.py

def score_kicker(weekly_k_df, league_cfg, granular: bool=False) -> pd.DataFrame:
    # baseline: FG=3, XP=1
    # if granular=True and splits exist, map 0–39=3, 40–49=4, 50+=5


	•	CLI flag: --k-distance-buckets

DoD: Ks appear with baseline values; flag flips to granular when data is present.

⸻

6) Replacement, VORP & tiers on the blended points

(You already have this—ensure it runs post-blend and includes DEF/K if present.)
	•	Confirm replacement counts: QB 12, RB 24, WR 24, TE 12 (+ FLEX reallocation).
	•	Ensure tier is deterministic (seed k-means), with quantile fallback.

DoD: Deterministic tiers between runs; FLEX allocation logged in console.

⸻

7) Diagnostics + caching + metadata
	•	Diagnostics (stdout): per-pos summary (count, replacement idx, baseline), top-12 table; warnings if anomalies.
	•	Cache: --cache data_cache/ → parquet by season for weekly & rosters (use pyarrow).
	•	Meta: write public/meta.json

{"generated_at":"...Z","target_year":2025,"lookback_years":[2024,2023,2022],
 "blend":[0.6,0.3,0.1],"per_game":true,"min_games":8,"schema_version":"0.1.0"}



DoD: Second run is much faster; meta.json exists and reflects flags.

Quick Code Stubs You’ll Reuse

Pick math (src/lib/snake.ts)

export const roundOf = (overall: number, teams=12) => Math.ceil(overall/teams)
export const pickInRound = (overall: number, teams=12) => ((overall-1)%teams)+1
export function nextTwoPicks(slot: number, currentPick: number, teams=12) {
  const round = roundOf(currentPick, teams)
  const isOdd = round % 2 === 1
  const order = isOdd ? slot : (teams - slot + 1)
  const firstOverall = (round-1)*teams + order
  const secondOverall = (round)*teams + (isOdd ? (teams - slot +1) : slot)
  return [firstOverall, secondOverall]
}

Tier badge (TierBadge.tsx)

export default function TierBadge({ tier }: { tier: number }) {
  const colors = {1:'bg-indigo-500',2:'bg-blue-500',3:'bg-emerald-500',4:'bg-yellow-500',5:'bg-orange-500',6:'bg-red-500'}
  return <span className={`px-2 py-0.5 text-xs text-white rounded ${colors[tier]||'bg-gray-500'}`}>T{tier}</span>
}

Bye badge (ByeBadge.tsx)

export function ByeBadge({ bye }: { bye?: number }) {
  return <span className="text-xs text-gray-500">{bye ? `Bye ${bye}` : ''}</span>
}

Override pill (OverrideBadge.tsx)

export function OverrideBadge({ source }: { source?: string }) {
  if (source !== 'override') return null
  return <span className="px-1.5 py-0.5 text-[10px] rounded bg-purple-600 text-white">OVR</span>
}


⸻

If you want, I can also zip a starter draftkid-ui with the boilerplate scaffolding (store, hooks, header, stubbed table/rail) so you can jump straight into columns and styling. Otherwise, this roadmap should give you a crisp, box-checkable path from backend → UI → GH Pages. You’ve got this. 🚀
# DraftKit / DraftKid – Dashboard Roadmap

**Status:** Phase 1 Backend & UI core features completed. Major backend scoring enhancements deployed (onesie discount, DST scoring, kicker scoring). UI professional table with tier headers, queue/drafted states, responsive design, keyboard shortcuts. 657 players load correctly.

**League target:** Yahoo 12‑team, 1.0 PPR, single‑QB, WR/WR/RB/RB/TE/FLEX/K/DEF, 6 BN, 2 IR.

---

## Phase 0 – Repo hygiene (one‑time)
- [x] `pyproject.toml` + editable install (`python -m draftkit`, `draftkit` entrypoint)
- [x] MIT license, CONTRIBUTING, CI for backend tests
- [ ] UI lint/format: **ESLint + Prettier** (consistent imports, tailwind class sorting)
- [ ] UI CI: **GitHub Actions** build + Pages deploy (vite build → `dist/`)

**DoD:** `npm run lint` passes; PRs run CI for Python + UI; Pages auto‑deploys from `main`.

---

## Phase 1 – BEFORE DRAFT (must‑have for your league)

### 1A) Backend – projection & scoring correctness
- [x] Lookback blend per‑game → 2025 projection (`--lookback --blend --per-game --min-games`)
- [x] Bye weeks from 2025 schedules → `bye` per player
- [x] Replacement/VORP on *projected* points; FLEX allocation; deterministic tiers
- [x] **Onesie discount** for single‑QB leagues (and optional TE):
  - Flag: `--onesie-discount qb=0.90,te=1.00` (applies to *VORP* before overall ranks)
  - **DoD:** QB1/QB2 land ~late‑2nd/early‑3rd overall; TE unaffected by default ✅
- [x] **DST scoring** (Yahoo exact): sacks, INT, FR, TD, safety, block, return TD, **PA bands** (12/10/7/4/1/0/−4)
  - New: `transforms/scoring_dst.py` → `pos="DEF"`, `player_id="DEF-<TEAM>"` ✅
- [x] **K scoring** baseline with distance buckets: `0–39=3, 40–49=4, 50+=5, XP=1`
  - New: `transforms/scoring_kicker.py` with distance-based scoring ✅
- [x] **Overrides** for rookies/role changes: `overrides.csv` → sets `points`, adds `source="override"`
- [x] Diagnostics (stdout): per‑pos counts, replacement index/baseline, Top‑12 preview
- [x] Cache pulls to parquet (`--cache data_cache/`) and export `public/meta.json`

### 1B) UI – board that drafts well
- [x] Sticky toolbar: position chips, tiers, search, **player count**, **density toggle** (Comfort/Compact)
- [x] Professional table: sticky header; zebra/hover; right‑aligned numbers w/ tabular‑nums; VORP signed/color
- [x] Tier group headers (Tier 1/2/3…); tooltips for **VORP** and **Round**
- [x] Queue star (☆/★) + left accent for queued; **Draft** button w/ disabled state; row mute when drafted
- [x] Mobile: hide Bye/Round; horizontal scroll; sticky first columns for rank/queue
- [ ] **Right rail** (War Room):
  - Roster card (QB, RB×2, WR×2, TE, FLEX, K, DEF, Bench) + **bye‑collision meter**
  - Queue card (drag to reorder, numbered)
  - Pick Tracker card (set draft slot, show next two picks using snake math)
- [ ] **Import/Export session**: export JSON (queue, drafted, slot); import back to restore state
- [ ] **Keyboard shortcuts**: `/` focus search (done), **`q` queue**, **`d` draft**, **`?` help modal**
- [ ] **Print mode**: high‑contrast, condensed rows; hide controls when printing

**DoD (Phase 1):** Onesie discount + DEF/K implemented and visible in ranks; right rail + shortcuts live; print sheet looks clean.

---

## Phase 2 – Strategy & quality (next 72 hours)

### 2A) Backend – richer signal, still nflverse‑only
- [ ] **Consistency metrics**: export `gp`, `ppg`, `stdev`, `p10_share`, `p15_share`, `p20_share`
- [ ] **CSV cheat sheets**: `--csv-out` → `public/cheatsheet_overall.csv` and `_pos.csv`
- [ ] **Tier method toggle**: `--tier-method kmeans|quantile`, `--tiers K` + fixed random seed
- [ ] **Age/role priors** (configurable YAML or flags):
  - RB age ≥30: −3% to −6%; 2nd/3rd‑year RBs +2% to +4%
  - **DoD:** Henry/Kamara slightly down; Bijan/Gibbs slightly up; documented in `meta.json`
- [ ] **Market deviation (optional)**: accept a tiny `market_anchor.json` (names + small bump %) and export `delta_vs_anchor` for transparency; no external fetch
- [ ] **Schema version & JSON schema**: add `schema_version` to meta; publish `docs/players.schema.json`

### 2B) UI – clarity & exports
- [ ] Column toggles for **Consistency** metrics; tooltips (“% of weeks ≥ 15 pts in lookback seasons”)
- [ ] Download buttons for **CSV cheat sheets**
- [ ] **Settings modal**: show effective lookback, blend weights, tier method, onesie discount; persist to localStorage
- [ ] **Run detector** chip (≥3 picks same position in last 6 drafted)
- [ ] **Stack hints** (QB + WR same team) toggle in right rail
- [ ] **Dark mode** (prefers‑color‑scheme) with kept tier colors

**DoD (Phase 2):** Consistency columns and CSV exports usable; settings persist; run detector and stack hints provide live cues.

---

## Phase 3 – Later (post‑draft niceties)
- [ ] **Strength of Schedule (lite)**: prior‑year defensive vs position index → `sos_rank` (document limits)
- [ ] **Injury/missed‑time flags**: `gp_share` trend → LOW/MED/HIGH risk tag
- [ ] **PWA/offline**: simple service worker for cached `players.json` (read‑only board)
- [ ] **Read‑only share mode**: URL param to load state but disable actions
- [ ] **Multi‑league profiles**: save multiple league configs + switcher
- [ ] **i18n minimal** (labels only)

---

## Phase 4 – Testing, QA, and docs
- [ ] **Backend tests**: scoring functions (offense, DST, K), replacement & FLEX allocation, bye computation
- [ ] **UI unit tests**: Vitest + React Testing Library (filters, sorting, queue/draft state)
- [ ] **E2E**: Playwright basic flows (search, queue, draft, keyboard shortcuts)
- [ ] **Docs**: `README` (build flags examples), `docs/ROADMAP.md` kept up to date, screenshots
- [ ] **Release hygiene**: semantic version bump, CHANGELOG, GitHub release notes

---

## Open Questions / Decisions
- Onesie defaults: `qb=0.90` in single‑QB? `te=0.98` or `1.00`?
- Will we accept a tiny manual `market_anchor.json` for elite WR bump (+2–3%) or remain strictly nflverse‑only?
- K distance buckets: if data coverage is incomplete, keep baseline as default and require `--k-distance-buckets` to opt‑in.
